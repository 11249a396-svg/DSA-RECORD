Experiment Name:
Binary Search in an Array
Program No: 2

AIM:
To write a C program to search an element in an array using Binary Search.

ALGORITHM:
Binary Search Algorithm (for Sorted Array)
1.Start
2.Input the size of the array n.
3.Input the array elements A[0], A[1], ..., A[n-1] in sorted order.
4.Input the element to search, say key.
5.Set low = 0, high = n - 1.
6.Repeat until low <= high:
• Compute mid = (low + high) / 2
• If A[mid] == key, then print "Element found at position mid + 1" and stop.
• Else if A[mid] < key, set low = mid + 1.
• Else set high = mid - 1.
7.If low > high, print "Element not found".
8.Stop

PROGRAM:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, key, low, high, mid, i, found = 0;

    printf("Enter the size of the array: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int A[n];
    printf("Enter %d elements in sorted order:\n", n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &A[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter the element to search: ");
    scanf("%d", &key);

    low = 0;
    high = n - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        mid = (low + high) / 2;

        if (A[mid] == key) {
            printf("Element found at position: %d\n", mid + 1);
            found = 1;
            break;
        } else if (A[mid] < key) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    if (!found) {
        printf("Element not found\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

INPUT:
Enter the size of the array: 5
Enter 5 elements in sorted order: 5 10 15 20 25
Enter the element to search: 20

OUTPUT:
Element found at position 4

RESULT:
The program to search an element in an array using Binary Search was successfully implemented, executed, and verified.
